# Instructions

1. Make sure the monkey video is in the same directory as the main.py program.
1. Make sure there is a folder called output on the same level.
1. run the program as below

```
python main.py
```

When the program finishes an output video called outputVid.avi should be produced.

The output video should show red dots around the blocks that have a magnitude of at
least 10. The size of the red dots are all the same. To save time on computation,
only 250 frames are read in from the input video with the final output video containing
248 frames in total. The playback of the output video is at 24 frames per second which gives us
around 10 seconds of video.
