    \section{Introduction}
    The task of this assignment was to program a short video involving digital video processing, compositing and 2D animation techniques.\
    The output is a piece of animation based on the provided clip. The video was of a marionette monkey with red markers on the head, hands\
    abd feet. Our task invovled tracking these red markets in order to determine the motion of the marionette monkey and recreate it with\
    our own character. The programming language used to complete this assignment was python3 on the windows operating system.

    \section{Implementation}
    The red parts of the monkey were found by first converting the frames to HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and then applying a threshold. The\
    use of HSV to threshold the red parts of the monkey proved to be far superior to using RGB. The segmentation of the red markersr was\
    enhanced by performing two iterations of morphological erosion operations followed by a single iteration dilation operation and finally\
    another iteration of erosion. An elliptical structuring element of was used to perform these morphological operations.

      \subsection{Algorithm}
      The K-Medoids algorithm was used to discern the the red dots into proper clusters to identify each part of the monkey. Those parts being\
      the head, two arms and two legs. The initial centers of the clusters were manually set to be as close to the middle of each of the monkey\
      parts as possible.

      \subsection{Experimental Results}
      In trying to find the red dots on the monkey, various morphological techniques were used. Performing a closing operating resulted in the\
      "clusters" that had very low dissimilarity.
      \\\\
      An opening operation yielded a result where the 5 red markers were more easy to discern and very dissimilar to each other.
      \\\\
      Various other operations such as alternating between erosion and dilation operations with different number of itereations were performed.\
      Eroding for more than 2 iterations before performing a dilation resulted in too few red pixels being retained. If dilating was performed first,\
      the red dots joined too close to each other. This resulted in poorer cluster centers.
      \\\\
      Various structuring elements were used when experimenting with the morophological operations. A square structuring element was found to...

    \section{Conclusion}
    The implementation of k-medoids was very susceptible to noise. Fast movements would often results in the clusters being messed up.\
    The crossing over of red markers did not...
